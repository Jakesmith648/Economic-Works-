### Starbucks Financial Performance Analysis 

Purpose:
This analysis evaluates Starbucks Corporation’s financial performance and adherence to GAAP reporting standards through detailed horizontal, vertical, and trend analyses.

Key Focus Areas:

Horizontal & Vertical Analysis: Compared Starbucks’ receivables, fixed assets, and debt financing between 2021–2022, identifying key asset growth trends and debt structure shifts.

Ratio Analysis: Computed liquidity (current, acid-test), solvency (debt-to-asset, debt-to-equity), and profitability (net margin, ROA) ratios. Benchmarked against Tim Hortons, McDonald’s, and the Consumer Discretionary sector.

Findings:

Liquidity ratios showed tightening cash flexibility (current ratio ↓ 0.43 pts).

Solvency revealed high debt leverage (95th percentile in industry).

Profitability remained resilient (ROA ≈ 13.3%, outperforming 94% of peers).

Regulatory Insight: Summarized Starbucks’ compliance with SEC rules and Sarbanes-Oxley Act internal control requirements, confirming robust financial governance.

Tools & Methods Used:
Excel | EViews | Python (for ratio automation) | GAAP & SEC standards

Outcome:
Delivered a comprehensive econometric-style financial evaluation integrating accounting, ratio benchmarking, and internal control analysis — a model replicable for firm-level forecasting and credit evaluation.

### U.S. Economic Impact and Policy Evaluation (Applied Economics Paper)

(from your second uploaded document)

Purpose:
Assessed macroeconomic policy outcomes on employment, inflation, and GDP trends using econometric reasoning and real data from Federal Reserve and BEA sources.

Key Contributions:

Built regression-based analysis linking fiscal stimulus and labor market performance post-pandemic.

Conducted elasticity and multiplier effect calculations to interpret federal spending efficiency.

Evaluated policy lag effects on inflation control using time-series data visualization (Jupyter Notebook).

Skills Highlighted:
Econometric modeling, data cleaning (Pandas), and macroeconomic interpretation.

Outcome:
Produced a policy-facing analysis illustrating how data-driven econometric evaluation can inform fiscal decisions — relevant to forecasting and policy research positions.

### Business Analytics & Predictive Modeling Project (Quantitative Methods)

(from your third document)

Purpose:
Applied statistical inference and predictive analytics to corporate operational datasets to forecast performance metrics and evaluate decision alternatives.

Key Components:

Built regression and correlation models to identify determinants of firm profitability.

Utilized Minitab, Python, and Jupyter to generate descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, and predictive trends.

Created Power BI dashboards to visualize KPI fluctuations and optimize managerial insight.

Outcome:
Demonstrated proficiency in statistical modeling and visualization for decision support — connecting analytics to economic interpretation.

### Portfolio Summary 

Jacob L. Smith – Applied Economics Graduate | Data Analytics & Econometrics

This portfolio showcases my applied economic and analytical work, ranging from firm-level financial analysis performed to macroeconomic forecasting and predictive modeling. Each project integrates data analysis, statistical rigor, and economic interpretation to inform business and policy decisions.

My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Minitab, Jupyter Notebooks, and Snowflake, applied across forecasting, econometric modeling, and visualization contexts.

Collectively, these projects demonstrate my ability to translate quantitative data into actionable economic insight — skills directly relevant to economic forecasting, data analytics, and consulting roles.
